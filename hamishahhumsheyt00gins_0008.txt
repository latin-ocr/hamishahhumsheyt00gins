The text presented in this book is that of the first edition of
Jacob ben Chayim's Massoretic Recension, printed by Bomberg at
Venice in 1524-5. No changes have been made in it beyond the
correction of obvious errors as indicated by the MSS. collated. But
at the foot of each page are placed all the variations from that text,
including its accents, which are to be found 111 a larger number of
ancient MSS. and early printed editions than were ever before collated
so niinutely and fully.

This elaborate collation has been rendered possible by the
unique collection in the British Museum of Hebrew Biblieal MSS.
and of copies printed before 1524-5. It has been effected with much
labour during a long period by Dr. C. D. Ginsburg, and the results,
as edited by him, are issued to the public by the British and For-eign
Bible Society as one of the memoriale of its Centenary.

Subjoined is a list of MSSâ€ž early editions, and ancient Versions
accompanied by the Hebrew letter or letters by which they are
respectively quoted in the sootnotes.

In an undertaking of this magnitude, some errors may be found
in the book. It will be a kindness if any detected are cominunicated
to the Editor through the Society as soon as possible, in order that
any necessary corrections may be made in the plates before other
editions are struck off.

The rest of the Old Testament is under preparation by the
same Editor for similar issue.
